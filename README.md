# Customer_Churn_Prediction

This project is based on a workplace scenario, where Waze contracted my company for building predictive models to provide them with customer churn predictions.

#### Project Status: [Completed]

## Project Overview and Description

- The purpose of this project is to design a machine learning model that provides predictions on whether a customer will retain or churn.

- As part of feature engineering, new variables are created using existing variables. 

- The models built were then fit to the training data and their performance was checked using validation set. The champion model was then tested using unseen test data.

- The jupyter notebook provided is a walk-through of the whole project with step-by-step explanations, codes and their outputs.

### Methods Used
* Predictive Modeling and Machine Learning: 
    Random Forest
    XGBoost

### Technologies
* Python
* Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, sklearn, XGBoost

## Needs of this project
- Statistical modeling and interpretation
- Reporting
